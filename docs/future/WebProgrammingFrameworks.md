Programming Frameworks
======================

Description
-----------

This course strengthens students' core technical ability of Web application system development.

* Build the knowledge and skills required for the development of web systems based on front-end and back-end separation, which lays a solid technical foundation for the development of enterprise-level web application systems.
* Students independently select technologies to solve a business problem based on a specification
* Though independent use of mainstream web frameworks, students build an understanding of the features of programming frameworks
* Use professionally relevant development tools and processes (version control, continuous integration, containers)


Learning Goals
--------------

1. Understand that modern web applications are often split into multiple components (backend, frontend)
2. Independently select a variety frameworks solve a business problem/specification
3. Use a framework to create a RESTful API server that meets to an specification (e.g. OpenAPI spec)
4. Use a framework to create single page webapp client/frontend that uses a RESTful server
5. Use a visual layout framework to facilitate responsive design
6. Use automated test frameworks to test each component and integration test the overall application
7. Use version control and continuous integration to monitor ongoing development
8. Use containerisation to facilitate development and deployment of a multi component system (backend, frontend)
9. Use a variety of programming languages that are suited to different problem domains (backend, frontend)
10. Understand a variety of alternate patterns for web application development. Including: server-rendered, serverless, static site generation, unified server-client state systems (e.g. Distributed REActive Memoization)
11. Justify technology used using technical language (verbally and written)


Learning and Teaching Strategies
--------------------------------

* The module will be taught in a lab using mixed mode delivery as required, so that theory, practical and discussion can take place as required within one session.
* Students will demonstrate progress in their assignment and will have the opportunity to gain feedback of their understanding in each session through the artefacts they are working on.
